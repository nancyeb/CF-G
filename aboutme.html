    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> Hello! My name is Mathilde and I am a Registered Nutritionist on the UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists with the Association for Nutrition (AfN).<br> Food is an essential part of life, should be enjoyed and should not be something to feel guilty or stressed about. I will never recommend faddy diets, pills, shakes or anything without an evidence base. <br> If you would like to find out more about me/what I offer, please do not hesitate to get in touch via my contact page.</p>

    <div>
    <h2>My background</h2>
    <p> I have been working in public health, specifically weight management and healthy lifestyle, for over 6 years. I mostly have experience working with the early years including postnatal mothers. I am passionate about educating people on nutrition and helping them to improve their health through diet (as well as physical activity), whilst also considering their individual lifestyle. There is no 'one size fits all' approach and I like to get to know clients to understand how best I can help them. </p>
    <h2>What is the AfN?</h2>
    <p> The AfN is a registered charity and is an independent regulator for Registered Nutritionists in the UK. It serves to protect and benefit the public, by ensuring that all registrants are competent, qualified nutrition professionals who meet their rigorously applied standards for scientifically sound evidence-based nutrition and its use in practice.  The UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists is the only register of qualified nutritionists </p>

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p> I will <b><u>not</b></u> see clients with a particular clinical condition or disease. This is outside of my realm of expertise/training and would breach the <a href="http://www.associationfornutrition.org/Portals/0/Public/Registration/AfN%20Standards%20Ethics%20Conduct%20Performance.pdf">AfN Standards of Ethics, Conduct and Performance</a> In this situation, you will need to either obtain a GP referral to see a Registered Dietician on the NHS, or seek a private freelance Registered Dietician. This can be found via the <a href= "https://freelancedietitians.org/"> British Dietetic Association</a> </p>
